# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics for the GitFixAI frontend React application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- Added `@vercel/analytics` package (version ^1.6.1) to the project dependencies

### 2. Modified Files
- **src/App.jsx**: Added Analytics component integration
  - Imported `Analytics` from `@vercel/analytics/react`
  - Added `<Analytics />` component inside the Router component to track page views across all routes

### 3. Updated Lock Files
- **package.json**: Added @vercel/analytics dependency
- **package-lock.json**: Updated with new package and its dependencies

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows the recommended approach for React applications as per Vercel's documentation:
- Used the `@vercel/analytics/react` import for React-specific integration
- Placed the Analytics component at the root level (inside Router) to ensure tracking across all routes
- The Analytics component will automatically track page views and provide route support for React Router

## Verification

- ✅ Build completed successfully with no errors
- ✅ Linting passed for modified files (no new errors introduced)
- ✅ Package successfully installed with 199 new packages

## Next Steps

Once deployed to Vercel:
1. Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel dashboard (Project → Analytics tab → Enable)
2. After deployment, verify tracking is working by checking browser Network tab for requests to `/_vercel/insights/view`
3. View analytics data in the Vercel dashboard under the Analytics tab

## Notes

- The Analytics component is lightweight and will only load on Vercel deployments
- Route tracking is automatically enabled for React Router
- No additional configuration is required for basic tracking functionality
